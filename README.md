# Selenium Grid Starter

This is guide on how to setup a Selenium Grid with most common browsers to run your WebdriverIO tests.

Check [./docs](https://github.com/presidenten/selenium-grid-starter/blob/master/docs/) on how to setup your own Selenium Grid.

The files mentioned in the docs can be found in [./docker](https://github.com/presidenten/selenium-grid-starter/blob/master/grid-in-docker/), [./mac](https://github.com/presidenten/selenium-grid-starter/blob/master/mac/) and [./windows](https://github.com/presidenten/selenium-grid-starter/blob/master/windows/) for convenience.

The only thing missing is the selenium webdrivers, that needs to be downloaded for the correct browser versions present on the selenium grid node.
